This repository contains all scripts I used for my bachelor thesis.

Within the discovery folder you can find an exemplary event log and a python script that uses the inducitve_miner to discover the process from the underlying event log.

Within the datagen folder you can find the data simulator scripts, I used to create synthetic data on the helpwave/services infrastructure. Moreover, it also contains the extrator scripts that do data reshaping and process discovery.

### Prerequisites

1. create a python venv
2. install requirements

### discovery

Just cd into the dir and run main.py

### datagen

Make sure that helpwave/service is running
